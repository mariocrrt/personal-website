    <p><b>What's the point of this website?</b></p>
    <article>
      This website serves as a multifaceted platform: it's both a display of my
      work and a repository for spontaneous brain dumps. Yet, its significance
      runs deeperâ€”it stands as a testament to the importance of internet
      independence. In an age where the internet is largely shaped by corporate
      giants, this site represents a commitment to autonomy and self-reliance
      online. By maintaining control over my content, I aim to foster an
      environment where genuine expression and individuality thrive, free from
      the constraints of algorithmic agendas. So, as you explore these digital
      corridors, remember the power of carving out your own space in the vast
      expanse of the internet.

    <p><b>No CSS? No JS? No 5MB parallax animations?!?</b></p>
    <article>
      In a digital world often cluttered with unnecessary features, I've opted
      for a more straightforward approach on this website. You'll notice the
      absence of CSS and JavaScript, and there are good reasons for that.
      <br />
      Firstly, it's about
      <a

        target="_blank"
        >combatting internet bloat</a
      >. CSS and JavaScript can slow down page loading times and make websites
      unnecessarily heavy. By skipping them, I'm ensuring a faster, more
      streamlined experience for visitors.
      <br />
      Secondly, much of what CSS and JavaScript offer isn't essential for the
      core content of this site. I believe in prioritizing substance over style,
      and a minimalist design accomplishes just that. <br />
      Additionally, a lightweight website means better accessibility for all.
      Whether you're using a high-end computer or a basic smartphone, you'll
      have no trouble accessing the content here. It's about inclusivity and
      making sure everyone can enjoy what's offered. <br />
      Lastly, by avoiding CSS and JavaScript, I'm sidestepping the need for
      tracking mechanisms like cookies. Privacy is important, and I want
      visitors to feel secure when browsing this site.

      <br /><br />
      <b><i>TL;DR</i> </b>By skipping CSS and JavaScript, I'm simplifying the
      web experience, ensuring speed, accessibility, and privacy for all users.
      It's about embracing the beauty of simplicity in a world that often
      prioritizes complexity.
